# Chatbot Sally - Friendly simple ChatGPT app

This is an example chatbot app base from the OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework. Chatbot can talk and reply to speech from user.

We add new feature that overcomes the weakness of ChatGPT - can't have updated information about weather, date and time with google search function.
